## Developer notes
I had node compatibility issues when running on replit so thats why in the .env Im forcing the website to be ran on a legacy version.
Due to this if deploying this website without changing the necessary code to be compatible with the latest node versions be aware there are security vulnerabilities.
```
8 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 6 high)
